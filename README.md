**need too look into conditions / diagnosis API(database) and same things with those specialties (meaning doctors that can treat those conditions ex: so we can get a proper match for condition; not a foot doctor for someone who needs cardiac surgery)

. Based on patients conditions, system will update client with list of recommended doctors/ specialists that they may want to see. 
.  Patients to be set up appointments with doctors that app recommends 
. Patients need to be able see doctors prognoses / prescription any notes left in general (notes on the case as to what doctor found that would lead that diagnosis / prescription )
